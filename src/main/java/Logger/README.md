# `Logger`

This folder is a little logger I made to make logs readable and not super garbled with unnecessary information.
There are different levels of messages: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and GOOD. Each level has an associated color.

The log methods are used *all over the project*, so if you decide to change something in here, be sure to 
refactor it and not just change it by itself.
